# diploma
my graduation project

In this priject I was engaged in the development of a messenger, the data transfer in which was based on the 
TCP/IP protocol. The application is client-server, where client is strong (takes over part of
information processing). Also there is a local SQLite database on the client. The
server is responsible for sending messages between users; PostgreSQL is used to
store information on the server. The application is a desktop, a graphical interface
created by using the Swing library. The server part is assembled with the help of
the Maven project automation framework. In the client part, JDBC is used to create
a connection with the SQLite database.
